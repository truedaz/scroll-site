I am trying to achieve a site with the functionality of this one:
http://www.beoplay.com/Products/BeoplayA9?utm_source=bang-olufsen.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Bang-Olufsen.com%2BProduct%2BPage&utm_term=EXPERIENCE%2BA9&utm_content=BeoPlay%2BA9%2B%3A%2BAll#placements


I want to be able to scroll automatically in window height blocks by either the mouse wheel or arrow keys - just like this site.

I also want a menu to go to the desired section.

- Issue's so far:
Scrolling and arrows work but menu gives bounce effect as both scripts are in effect. I am trying to specify:
if mouse or arrows do tis script
else if menu 
do this script.

just like the reference site.

Any help greatly appreciated with this fix :)
Thanks!
